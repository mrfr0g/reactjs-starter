# reactjs-starter

@credit http://jmfurlott.com/tutorial-setting-up-a-single-page-react-web-app-with-react-router-and-webpack/

I really wanted a dead simple reactjs starter kit. What do I mean by simple?

* No routing
* No CSS preloader
* No Flux
* Minimal files
* Minimal styles

## Getting started

* Clone the repo
* npm install

### Dev mode with hot dev server

* npm run watch
* access via http://localhost:8080/

### Build mode

* npm run build
* ...deploy using some other means, this project isnt about that

### Errors

... Promise is not defined
Use latest node
